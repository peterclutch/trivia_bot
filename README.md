# Slack Trivia Bot

Quick and dirty implementation of a Slack bot that can run a trivia game. Might clean up at some point ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Schedule

- **Monday** – generate trivia questions for the entire work week based on the current theme and ask Monday's question.
- **Tuesday–Friday** – ask the prepared question for the day and reveal yesterday's answer.
- **Saturday** – reveal Friday's answer and announce the weekly winner.
